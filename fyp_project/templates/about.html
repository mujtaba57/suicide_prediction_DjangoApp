 Suicide is considered one of the most serious social health problems in the modern world. Every year, almost 800,000 people commit suicide. Suicide remains the second leading cause of death among a young generation with an overall suicide rate of 10.5 per 100,000 people. Many factors can lead to suicide, for example, personal issues, such as hopelessness, severe anxiety, schizophrenia, alcoholism, or impulsivity; social factors, like social isolation and overexposure to deaths; or negative life events, including traumatic events, physical illness, aﬀective disorders.  A large number of people, especially teenagers, were reported having suicidal ideation.

People are using online communication platforms to communicate their sentiments, pain, and suicide intentions.

 It is one possible approach to preventing suicide eﬀectively is early detection of suicidal ideation. The subject of recognizing suicide ideation on online social platforms is investigated, with an emphasis on understanding and detecting suicidal ideas in online user material.
